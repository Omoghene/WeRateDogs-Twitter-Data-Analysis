# WeRateDogs-Twitter-Data-Analysis

WeRateDogs is a popular page on Twitter, which posts pictures, comments and 'ratings' of dogs. 
Fans of the page and other dog lovers mostly submit the pictures, and their dogs get rated based 
on peculiar poses or inferred behaviour, and probably just the mood of whoever is in charge of 
administrating this page. Ratings are often comical and good-witted, and meant to please the 
dog-loving audience. 
WeRateDogs has grown in popularity over the years, since the owner Matt Nelson, in college at 
the time, started it in 2015. A lot of effort goes into running this page, as it is estimated that Matt 
gets about 800 submissions a day, and, along with his team of four, have to work to trim all those 
down to one good post a day. 
We looked into the page's data and found that of all the dogs they posted, Pomeranians seem to 
be the highest rated breed. Samoyeds and Golden Retrievers are next.
Even though these appear to be Matt's (or whoever is administering the page's) favourite dogs, 
the twitter populace have different ideas. Bedlington Terriers have gotten the highest average 
favourites and retweets (which are a standard way of measuring audience engagement with 
Twitter posts). Next on the list are the Saluki and the Afghan hound. All three breeds are unique 
in their appearance, and it is easy to see why they are so loved. In addition, Cooper, Lucy and 
Charlie are the most popular dog names. Now you know what NOT to name your dog if you are
going to take them to the neighbourhood park. (On the other hand, what to name them if you are
looking to start conversations and make new friends! ;))
